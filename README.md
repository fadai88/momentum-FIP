The original paper underlying 'Frog in the Pan" idea can be found at https://www3.nd.edu/~zda/Frog.pdf
Momentum is a well-documented anomaly in financial markets. But not all momentums are creared equal. Some assets move in discrete steps; they don't move, so to speak, they jump. Their information discreteness (ID) is high. Other securities move 
more smoothly or continuously. Their ID is low. 

From the paper: 
"This hypothesis predicts that investors are less attentive to information arriving continuously in small amounts than to information with the same cumulative stock price implications that arrives in large amounts at discrete timepoints."

Authors hypothesize that stocks with low ID, those with continuous price moves will deliver higher returns than those jumping from one price to the next one in a short period.
